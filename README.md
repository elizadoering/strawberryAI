The two files represent each team member's tasks. 
'Strawberry_Eliza' contains the code for the Naive Bayes and SVM models. As of today (11/23/2020)
neither model is in a functional form. 
'Strawberry_Bobby' contains the code for the convolutional neural network. As of today (11/23/2020)
that model is not complete. 
Each file initially begins with file loading and labeling, but small changes have been made to enable 
model compatibility.

# strawberryAI
The two files represent each team member's tasks. 
'Strawberry_Eliza' contains the code for the Naive Bayes and SVM models. As of today (12/8/2020)
both models are in a functional form. 
'CNN_testing' contains the code for the convolutional neural network. As of today (12/8/2020)
that model is complete.
Each file initially begins with file loading and labeling, but small changes have been made to enable 
model compatibility. 
**To view use nbviewer (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) because jupyter files upload as HTML to github**
